    "4. Do you have any suggestions on things that we could try given that we have a mechanical model from previous work? x \n",

    "5. Can noise be removed more effectively? in the contact force paper he mentioned combining the readings of multiple sensors? \n",

    "6. Instantaneous speed estimation - Using cross correlation - can this be applied to audio signal? would a squared error be suitable for spectrograms from different time frames work? \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Why do you think there exists very little machine learning / data driven defect detection studies? For example, bad joints, voids and corrugation.\n",
